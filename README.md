## **5. Features / Highlights**  

### **Business Problem**

### **Goal of the Dashboard**  
â†’ Leverage Excel reporting and analytics to provide clear insights into:  
- Customer-level performance over multiple years  
- Country-wise market performance vs assigned targets  

### **Walkthrough of Key Visuals**  
- **Customer Performance Report** â†’ Tracks net sales for each customer from 2019 to 2021. Highlights top contributors like **Amazon and AtliQ Exclusive**, as well as emerging players such as Chiptec with high growth percentages.  
- **Market Performance vs Target Report** â†’ Compares **actual 2021 sales against set targets** across countries. For instance, **India, Canada, and Germany fell short of their goals**, leading to a global shortfall of â€“9.17%.  

### **Business Impact & Insights**  
- Identify **high-growth customers** for stronger partnerships and targeted offers.  
- Detect **underperforming markets** to re-evaluate sales strategies.  
- Enable data-driven negotiations with customers using YoY growth insights.
